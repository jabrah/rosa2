#core module
_TODO: move VIEWER code to separate module, both FSI viewer and built-in JS viewer._

  * history handling? (provide activities/places)
    * See rosa.gwt.common.client.Action (for Roman de la Rose website. There is an equivalent for Pizan)
  * some default widgets
    * CSV display: columns must be sortable, provide link to a Google Doc
    * Browsing books by category
    * Displaying book description/metadata
  * Base view interfaces/implementations

  * load data from archive (archive data service)
  * adapt to website model (CSVs)
    * Website model based off old idea of pre-prepared CSVs located in the WAR
    * Prepares the CSV data at initial request. Results cached for future requests.
  * Use Guice in server code, GIN in client code

##ArchiveDataService:
load data from the archive into the website. Any call to this service from the website
should cache the results. Use this service to front load data, store the website data in memory (or on file?)
on website initialization to avoid dependency on the archive?

BookCollections and Books are cached here to prevent unnecessary trips to the archive. Other objects are
cached inside the webapp to prevent unnecessary trips to the server.

  * ~~Copy things into the webapp to maintain proper Google crawlability?~~
  * BookDataCSV, CollectionCSV, IllustrationTitleCSV: pre-formatted CSVs to be displayed on screen
    as is. These should be available somewhere for download.
  * BookCollection, Book: load appropriate archive object on demand. Avoid loading these objects whenever possible, as they are very heavy weight and take a while to load/transfer.
  * Load pieces from a book, ex: image lists, permission statements, etc. All objects should be language aware if necessary.

##FSI data servlet 
_(TODO Move to a different module! In viewer module?)_

Service that reads a book and generates the configuration XMLs needed for the FSI flash viewer. These XMLs
cannot be cached in the webapp because it is the FSI viewer itself that calls this service, not the webapp.
The Books from which the XMLs are generated are cached, however.

##Basic navigation and history handling
Some pages are shared between the Rose and Pizan web sites, and will be necessary for future web sites.
They can be declared in the core and used in the web site modules.

  * Define: views, presenter interfaces, places
  * ~~GWT UIBinder for views?~~
  * GIN for DI
  * Navigation must keep old URL schemes. Fortunately, each web site "Action" seems to have a set prefix.
    Tokenizers defined by Places can use the @Prefix("") annotation to specify its URL fragment prefix. 
    For mapping the same Place to multiple URL fragment prefixes using the built-in HistoryMapper mechanism:
    <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10089964/places-that-share-all-but-prefix-or-how-to-use-placehistorymapperwithfactory>
  * Places needed:
    * Display collection data as CSV (collection data, collection book data, illustration titles)
    * Be able to display arbitrary number of static HTML pages in main content area
    * Display book description and metadata
    * Select book by criteria
    * Browse through a book by thumbnails and be able to view a single image that has been selected
    * Search/advanced search. Display results if query is not blank
  * Activities need some site-specific information, so can be defined in the distinct website modules.
