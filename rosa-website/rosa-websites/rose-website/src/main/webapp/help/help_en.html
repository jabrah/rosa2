<ul>
<li><strong>Repository</strong> - the name of the library or museum where the book is now held</li>
<li><strong>Common name</strong> - a shorthand name for the book  
<li><strong>Current location</strong> - the city where the book is now held</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong> - the date by century when the book was produced</li>

</ul>

<p class="topic"><a id="books">Looking at Books</a></p>
There are two ways to view books:
<ol>
<li class="term"><strong>Page turner</strong> - Flash animation enables you to move forward and backward through the book. A drop-down menu, located above the viewport, gives several options for examining folios. (No drop-down menu will appear if there is no metadata for that particular manuscript.)</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show</strong>: to view just the image</li>
<li><strong>Illustration description</strong>: to see illustration titles and keywords in a box to the right of the viewport, when available</li>
<li><strong>Transcription</strong>:  to read a transcription, when available. Click on the tabs at the top of the box for the next column of text on the folio</li>
<li><strong>Transcription [Lecoy]</strong>: to read a transcription with line numbers (from the Lecoy edition).</li>
 <li><strong>Narrative sections</strong>: to see the narrative section/s of displayed folios. The box to the right of the viewport gives the narrative section id in bold (with a question mark when this was generated by an algorithm and so only approximates the start), and the Lecoy line number which begins the section (in purple). For some manuscripts, the actual line beginning the section from Selden Supra 57 (here SS57) is also given.</li>
</ul>
<li class="term"><strong>Browse images</strong> - Thumbnail view of all the images in the book</li>
</ol>

<h4>Changing the amount of viewing space</h4>
<ul class="sea">
<li class="sea">Click on the <strong>Smaller</strong> button above the viewport to decrease the size of the viewing area.</li>
<li class="sea">Click on the <strong>Larger</strong> button above the viewport to increase the size of the viewing area.</li>
<li class="sea">Select the <strong>Popup</strong> button above the viewport to open the image in a new window without the top or left navigation buttons.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Getting a closer look at a folio</h4>
<ul class="sea">
<li class="sea">There are several ways to zoom in on an image.  In <strong>Browse images</strong>, clicking on the image zooms in on it.  In <strong>Page turner</strong>, the first click on an image allows you to select one of the two folios shown.  Subsequent clicks will zoom in on this folio only.</li> 
<li class="sea">Another way to zoom in is to click on the "Zoom In" button <img src="images/zoom_in.jpg" width="22" height="22" alt="zoom in button"/>. </li>
<li class="sea">To return to the default zooming mode after using the "Drag Image" button <img src="images/drag.jpg" width ="22" height="22" alt="drag button"/> or the "Tilt Image" button <img src="images/tilt.jpg" width ="22" height="22" alt="Tilt button"/>, click on the "Zoom Selection" button <img src="images/zoom_select.jpg" width ="22" height="22" alt="zoom select button"/>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Moving around an image</h4>
<ul class="sea">
<li class="sea">After zooming in on an area of a folio image, there are two ways to move to another area of the same folio. One way is to click on the "Drag Image" button <img src="images/drag.jpg" width ="22" height="22" alt="drag button" /> and then click on the folio and drag the cursor to the area.</li>
<li class="sea">Another way to move to another area of an image is to click on the red outline in the <a class="screen">survey window<b><img src="images/survey_w.png" alt="survey window" /></b></a> and move the cursor to the area.</li>  
</ul>

<h4>Getting a full view of the folio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Click on the "Zoom Out" button <img src="images/zoom_out.jpg" width="22" height="22" alt="zoom out button" /> to zoom out incrementally.</li>
<li>Click on the "Reset Image" button <img src="images/reset.jpg" width="22" height="22" alt="reset button" /> to return to the original view.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rotating an image</h4>
<ul>
<li>Click on the "Tilt Image" button <img src="images/tilt.jpg" width="22" height="22" alt="tilt button" /> to use the tilt function. Then click anywhere on the image and drag the cursor to rotate it.</li>
<p class="top"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p> 
</ul>

<h4>Comparing two folios</h4>
<p>Both <strong>Page turner</strong> and <strong>Browse images</strong> have a <strong>Popup</strong> button that will open the book in a separate window.  Use the <strong>Popup</strong> button to look at two images at once</p>  
<h4>In Page turner:</h4>
<ol>
<li>To find the first image: select a book, click on <strong>Page turner</strong>, and enter the folio number in the box above the viewport.</li>  
<li>Click on the <strong>Popup</strong> button above the viewport. A new window with this folio will open.</li>
<li>Go back to the viewport.</li> 
<li>Find the second image by selecting a book, clicking on <strong>Page turner</strong>, and entering the folio number in the box above the viewport or paging through to the folio.</li>  
<li>Click on the <strong>Popup</strong> button above the viewport.  A new window with this folio will open.</li>  
<li>You can resize and move both the windows.</li>
</ol>
<h4>In Browse images:</h4>
<ol>
<li>To find the first image: select a book, click on <strong>Browse images</strong>, browse thumbnail images to find a folio.</li>
<li>Select a thumbnail image.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Popup</strong> button above the vieweport. A new window with this folio will open.</li>
<li>Go back to the viewport.</li>
<li>Find the second image by selecting a book, clicking on <strong>Browse images</strong>, and browsing thumbnail images to find a folio.</li>
<li>Select a thumbnail image.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Popup</strong> button above the viewport. A new window with this folio will open.</li>
<li>Resize and move the two windows if desired.</li>
</ol>
Another way to compare folios is to open up two browser windows.

<p class="topic"><a id="search">Search</a></p>
<h4>Basic Search Tips</h4>
<ul class="sea">
<li class="sea">A basic search consists of entering a set of terms. A term can be either a phrase or a word.
Phrases must be enclosed in double quotes. </li>

<li class="sea">A proximity search is done by adding the optional '~NUMBER' suffix to a phrase. This sets a requirement that words in the phrase be within NUMBER words of each other.</li>

<li class="sea">Boolean operators '+', (must be present), and '-', (must not be present), are used by starting a term with them.</li>

<li class="sea">Single word terms have additional search options. The '~' suffix specifies fuzzy matching. The '*' character matches multiple
characters. The '?' character matches any single character.</li>

<li class="sea">If a word or phrase is not Boolean, does not use wildcards, and does not do fuzzy matching:</li>
<ol>
 <li class="term">Words that match French character names also match variants of the character name</li>
 <li class="term">When searching Old French, words also match Old French spelling variants</li>
</ol>
<li class="sea">Results are ordered by relevance, and the option to perform an advanced search is presented.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Advanced Search</h4>
<ul class="sea">
<li class="sea">You can search across books and narrow your search by:</li>
<ol>
 <li class="term"> choosing which field(s) to include in the query by using the "Add Field" button.</li>
 <li class="term"> choosing which books are searched</li>
</ol>
<li class="sea">Refer to the <a href="#glossary">glossary below</a> for a definition of terms found in the <strong>Advanced Search</strong> tool.
</ul>
