<h3>Extant Manuscripts</h3>

<div class="gwt-HTML">
    <p>
    Below is a spreadsheet of all known manuscripts and fragments of the poem. Printed books are not included in this list.
    </p>
    <p>
        These manuscripts are listed in alphabetical order by country. A more precise location, usually the city,
        and then the institution and the shelfmark are also given. The fourth column,"olim," provides any
        previous names or shelfmarks for the manuscript. In the final two columns, "<em>De la Rose</em>"  and
        "Langlois," the letters Y and N indicate whether the manuscript can be found in either Catherine Bel and
        Herman Braet's <em>De la Rose: texte, image, fortune</em> (2006) or in Ernest Langlois's <em>Les Manuscrits
        du Roman de la Rose, description et classement</em> (1910).
