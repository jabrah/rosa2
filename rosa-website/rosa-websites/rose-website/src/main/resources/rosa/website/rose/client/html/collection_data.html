<h3>Collection spreadsheet</h3>

<p>Certain information from all manuscripts in this collection has been gathered into a spreadsheet. Below you see a portion of this spreadsheet displayed in tabular form. </p><p>The "date" column provides a date range, usually the century in which the manuscript was made; "texts" gives the number of different texts in the manuscript; "folios" is the number of folios with the poem, and "ills." the number of illustrations of the poem; "cols." is the number of columns per folio, and "lines" is roughly how many lines in each column. The "size" column provides the manuscript's height and width in millimeters, and "structure" the number of leaves in gatherings if this information is known. The final ">1 ill." column is a count of the number of folios with more than one illustration. </p><p>Manuscript names are hyperlinked and the spreadsheet itself can also be downloaded in CSV format.</p>
