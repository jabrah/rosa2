  <h3><em>Christine de Pizan</em> Digital Scriptorium</h3>
  
  <p>
Welcome to the Christine de Pizan Digital Scriptorium, a joint project of the <a href="http://margot.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo’s MARGOT project</a>, the <a href="http://www.library.jhu.edu/">Sheridan Libraries</a> of Johns Hopkins University and the <a href="http://www.bnf.fr/">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a>. The creation of this resource and the digitization of manuscripts from the BnF were made possible by generous support from the <a href="http://www.ontario.ca/ministry-research-innovation">Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation</a>.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the Christine de Pizan Digital Scriptorium is to create an online library of all manuscripts containing the works by this author. We currently have digital surrogates of 56 of her works’ manuscripts, which represent the collection held at the BnF consortium, and our collection continues to grow.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the fully digitized surrogates, this Digital Scriptorium features basic and detailed codicological descriptions, a brief biography of Christine de Pizan and her contributions to the literary, socio-political and cultural climate of late medieval France and England, a list of the illustration titles of the miniatures contained in the manuscripts, and much more. 
</p>

<p>
Through the efforts of our project team, the Digital Scriptorium has been developed as a resource for scholars and students in a variety of disciplines, as well as for a wider public. All users must review and accept our <a href="#terms">terms and conditions</a>.
