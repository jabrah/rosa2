<h3>History and Summary of the Text by Lori J. Walters</h3> 
    <p>The <em>Roman de la Rose</em> is the work of two authors. Begun by Guillaume
de Lorris around 1230 and continued by Jean de Meun approximately forty
years later, the <em>Rose</em> is probably the most influential work written in
the Old French vernacular. In the centuries following its composition,
major poets like Guillaume de Machaut, Jean Froissart, Eustache
Deschamps, and Francois Villon continued to write in a tradition
dominated by the work which, in some manuscripts, extends to 21,750
lines. In the early 15th century, the <em>Rose</em> was still capable of
sparking heated literary debate in France. Other national literatures
felt the effect of the <em>Rose</em> as well. The English poets John Gower and
Geoffrey Chaucer and the Italian poets Dante and Petrarch were astute
readers of the work. <br><br>
    The <em>Roman de la Rose</em> is an allegorical love poem which takes the form
of a dream vision. The 25-year-old narrator recounts a dream he had
approximately five years previously, which has since come to pass. In
his dream he journeyed to a walled garden in which he viewed rosebushes
in the Fountain of Narcissus. When he went to select his own special
blossom, the God of Love shot him with several arrows, leaving him
forever enamored of one particular flower. His efforts to obtain the
Rose met with little success. A stolen kiss alerted the guardians of
the Rose, who then enclosed it behind still stronger fortifications. At
the point where Guillaume de Lorris' poem breaks off, the protagonist,
confronted with this new obstacle to the realization of his love, is
left lamenting his fate. Jean de Meun concludes the narrative with a
bawdy account of the plucking of the Rose, achieved through deception,
which is very unlike Guillaume's idealized conception of the love
quest. <br><br>
    The sections of the <em>Rose</em> composed by Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de
Meun have markedly different characters. Guillaume's work is a fairly
comprehensive handbook on the art of romantic love. The personified
likenesses of anti-courtly vices arrayed on the walls of the garden
provide an instructive contrast to the figures of courtly virtue who
dance within the confines of the enclosure. The God of Love gives
specific recommendations to the neophyte on the conduct becoming a
lover. In Jean de Meun's hand, Guillaume's original plot line
concerning a young man's quest for the Rose is made to encompass a
great deal of 13th-century learning. His personified characters (Lady
Reason, the Lover, Nature, Genius for example) add lengthy commentary
on subjects often allied to the action in only a peripheral way. Among
other topics, he includes discussions on free will versus determinism
as well as on optics and the influence of heavenly bodies on human
behavior. Contemporary issues like the debate about the growing power
of the mendicant orders also find their way into his work.</p>

<h3>The Manuscripts by Beatrice Radden Keefe</h3>

<p>
About 320 manuscripts and manuscript fragments containing all or parts of the <em>Rose</em> poem
    survive. With dates ranging from the 13th to the 16th century, <em>Rose</em> manuscripts are
   kept mainly in European libraries, and most remain in France where they were first produced.  A late 13th-century copy of the poem now held by the BnF is <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Francais378.001r">Français 378</a>. Made not long after Jean wrote his continuation, this manuscript includes 40 column miniatures illustrating Guillaume's section of the poem as well as several prefacing texts. A much later illustrated <em>Roman de la Rose</em> is <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Morgan948.001r">Morgan 948</a> in the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York. With 107 single- and double-column miniatures, this deluxe manuscript was
    produced ca. 1520, after the first editions of the poem were printed at the end of the 15th century (for examples of these, see <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Rosen0396.A2r">Rosenwald 396</a>, an incunable, and <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Rosen0917.A1v">Rosenwald 917</a>, an early printed book). In the case of <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Morgan948.001r">Morgan 948</a>, both Guillaume and Jean's sections of the poem have illustrations. 
<br><br>
Many <em>Rose</em> manuscripts are illustrated, some with
large cycles of miniatures and lavishly painted with gold and colored
pigments. Others are unillustrated or have a single opening illustration and so represent a less costly
undertaking (<a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Senshu2.001r">Senshu 2</a> and <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Senshu3.001r">Senshu 3</a> are both unillustrated). In several of these manuscripts, spaces were left for
illustrations that were never begun, possibly because their makers
ran out of time or funds. (Look at <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Francais803.001r">Français 803</a> for examples of unfinished illustrations.)
<br><br>
Something is known of the artists responsible for individual <em>Roman de la Rose</em>
manuscripts. Professional illuminators Richard de Montbaston and
his wife Jeanne (fl. 1325-1353), who lived and worked together on the
rue Neuve Notre-Dame in Paris, are thought to have illustrated as many as 20
<em>Rose</em> manuscripts between them, including the <em>Rose</em> in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Walters143.001r">Walters 143</a>, as well as <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Francais802.001r">Français 802</a> and <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Arsenal3338.001r">Arsenal 3338</a> in Paris. Also, miniatures in
a <em>Rose</em> now in Oxford (<a href="#read;Douce195.001r">Douce 195</a>) are considered the work of
Robinet Testard (fl. 1475-1523), the illuminator of a number of 
books produced for Charles d'Orléans, count of Angoulême, and his wife Louise de Savoie.
<br><br>
The grandest of <em>Rose</em> manuscripts were made for
    and owned by noble patrons and members of the French royal court. With 125 miniatures, <a href="#read;Douce195.001r">Douce 195</a> is thought to have been made especially for Louise de Savoie
(1476-1531), the countess of Angoulême and regent queen of France
(r. 1515-1516), while the <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Morgan948.001r">Morgan <em>Rose</em></a>  manuscript was intended as a gift for her son,
    François I, king of France (r. 1515-1547). We find him being presented the manuscript in the full-page miniature at the beginning of Morgan 948 (<a href="#read;Morgan946.0001r">folio 4r</a>). Less costly and
    unillustrated manuscripts might have been owned by wealthy families or learned individuals such as Christine de Pizan, Jean de Montreuil, the brothers Gontier and Pierre Col, and Jean Gerson, who debated aspects of the poem in the earliest years of the 15th century.
<br><br>
Certain <em>Rose</em> manuscripts are in pristine condition
and appear as though they were hardly ever opened and read. But there
are also examples of works that were quite clearly often thumbed
through and looked at, and many of these now have missing folios,
illustrations that are damaged or removed, and notes jotted in their
margins. In the <a href="http://romandelarose.org/#read;Walters143.001r">Walters <em>Rose</em></a> manuscript scenes of a Dominican friar with a woman (<a href="#read;Walters143.069v">folio 69v</a>) and
a dog dressed in a Dominican habit and followed by three smaller dogs
(<a href="#read;Walters143.072v">folio 72v</a>) have been added to the lower margins of two folios. This gives us an idea of
the range of ways the poem might have been read and interpreted, and <em>Rose</em> manuscripts used and adapted for different uses, in the late Middle Ages and beyond.
