    <h3><em>Roman de la Rose</em> Digital Library</h3>

<p>
    Welcome to the <em>Roman de la Rose</em> Digital Library, a joint project of the
    <a href="http://www.library.jhu.edu/">Sheridan Libraries</a> of Johns Hopkins University and the <a href="http://www.bnf.fr/">Biblioth√®que
nationale de France</a>. The creation of this resource and the digitization
of manuscripts from the BnF was made
possible by generous support from the <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>.

The goal of the <em>Roman de la Rose</em> Digital Library is to create an online
    library of all manuscripts containing the 13th-century poem <em>Roman de la Rose</em>. We currently have digital surrogates of more than 130 <em>Roman de la Rose</em> manuscripts, and our collection continues to grow.

    This Digital Library features new content and enhanced functionality, and builds upon the previously developed prototype <a href="#project"><em>Roman de la Rose</em>: Digital Surrogates of Medieval Manuscripts</a>. We are continuing our relationship with the founding partners of the
Digital Surrogates project, including the <a href="http://www.thewalters.org/"> Walters Art Museum</a>, the<a href="http://www.ouls.ox.ac.uk/bodley">
    Bodleian Library</a>, the <a href="http://morganlibrary.org/">Morgan Library &amp; Museum</a>, and the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">J. Paul
Getty Museum</a>, while working with an ever-broadening group of new institutions and private collectors who have contributed digital images of their manuscripts. Through the efforts of our project team and advisory committee, the Digital Library has been developed as a resource for scholars in a variety of disciplines, as well as for a wider public. All users must review and accept our <a href="#terms">terms and conditions</a>.

    The collections, services, and infrastructure of the <em>Roman de la Rose</em>
Digital Library are intended to be dynamic. We look forward to engaging
the community to help us consider new content and different features to be added
over time, which will be discussed on the site's <a href="http://romandelarose.blogspot.com">blog</a>. In order to maintain and build the <em>Roman de la Rose</em> Digital Library, we will need support from this community. Please consider making a <a href="#donation">donation</a>.
