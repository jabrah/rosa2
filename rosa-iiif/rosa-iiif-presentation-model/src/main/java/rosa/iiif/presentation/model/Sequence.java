/**
 * The sequence conveys the ordering of the views of the object. The default sequence
 * (and typically the only sequence) must be embedded within the manifest, and may also
 * be available from its own URI. The default sequence may have a URI to identify it.
 * Any additional sequences must be referred to from the manifest, not embedded within
 * it, and thus these additional sequences must have an HTTP URI.
 *
 * The new {name} parameter in the URI structure must distinguish it from any other
 * sequences that may be available for the physical object. Typical default names for
 * sequences are “normal” or “basic”. Names should begin with an alphabetical character.
 *
 * Sequences may have their own descriptive, rights and linking metadata using the same
 * fields as for manifests. The label property may be given for sequences and must be
 * given if there is more than one referenced from a manifest. After the metadata, the set
 * of pages in the object, represented by canvas resources, are listed in order in the
 * canvases property. There must be at least one canvas given.
 *
 * Sequences may have a startCanvas with a single value containing the URI of a canvas
 * resource that is contained within the sequence. This is the canvas that a viewer should
 * initialize its display with for the user. If it is not present, then the viewer should
 * use the first canvas in the sequence.
 *
 * In the manifest example above, the sequence is referenced by its URI and contains only
 * the basic information of label, @type and @id. The default sequence should be written out
 * in full within the manifest file, as below but must not have the @context property.
