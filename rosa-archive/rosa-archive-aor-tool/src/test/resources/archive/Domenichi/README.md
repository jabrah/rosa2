## Note on file names

Names are ordered beginning with the first page containing text, and are therefore different from the scan numbers on ABO. 

A useful comparison chart:

```
ABO scan    File name     Actual pagination
5	right   Ha2.001r      321
6	left    Ha2.001v      322
6	right   Ha2.002r      323
7	left    Ha2.002v      324

8	left    Ha2.003v      326

## Note on workflow

All new transcriptions will be labeled "First pass: To be checked." This means that they still require additional checking. Commentary and corrections will then be noted accordingly.
